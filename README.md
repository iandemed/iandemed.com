### Overview

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/58cfb98c-0a5e-4105-aa18-4cac4b86931f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/iandemed/deploys)

[iandemed.dev](https://www.iandemed.dev/) is my personal portfolio website that I create using ReactJS. Currently, users are able to view a brief overview of some of my technical skills, a selection of projects from my GitHub account, and download my resume.

### Technology Used

1. [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - used to create the elements on the webpage. Currently they are simple, but it allows me to plan on expanding to a more complicated application in the future
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - used to install Bulma and node-sass for local development. I primarily used it in conjunction with [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to host the required CSS and Sass files remotely as an npm pacakage
3. JavaScript - to create a functioning hamburger menu for devices with a smaller screen width
4. Netlify - used to delploy my website. I am fan of their continous intergration via GitHub (which can even be specific to branches and subdirectories), generous free-tier plan, and their SSL/TLS certification

### Future Developments

I plan to implement a number of new features:

- Sections for Work experience, teaching experience, and previous research
- Blog section
- More specific project pages
- Visualization for all of the coffees I tried
- ~~Additional projects from my GitHub~~
   - Continue to update with additional projects
- ~~Refactor to build HTML elements with React~~
- Streamline CSS styling
- Custom splash image on initial navigation to home-page
