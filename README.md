### Overview

[iandemed.dev](https://www.iandemed.dev/) is my personal portfolio website that I create using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Bulma. Currently, users are able to view a brief overview of some of my technical skills, a selection of projects from my GitHub account, and download my resume.

##### So why Bulma?

I wanted to practice using a CSS framework and Bulma is very unopiniated about how I set up the rest of my website and requires no JavaScript, giving me a lot of flexibility during the development process. Bootstrap requires the usage of three different JavaScript libraries which would make it more difficult to rapidly prototype the construction of my portfolio and would require a larger upfront time investment.

### Technology Used

1. [Bulma](https://www.bulma.io.com/) - used to create the CSS styling for my webpage
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - used to install Bulma and node-sass for local development. I primarily used it in conjunction with [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to host the required CSS and Sass files remotely as an npm pacakage
3. JavaScript - to create a functioning hamburger menu for devices with a smaller screen width
4. Netlify - used to delploy my website. I am fan of their continous intergration via GitHub (which can even be specific to branches and subdirectories), generous free-tier plan, and their SSL/TLS certification

### Future Developments

I plan to implement a number of new features:

- Sections for Work experience, teaching experience, and previous research
- Additional projects from my GitHub
- Refactor to build HTML elements with React
